  Step ${ paternity_idx }: Learn about paternity

  <div class='step-subheading'>Paternity</div>

  Paternity refers to a child’s legal father. Only a child’s legal father has the rights and responsibilities of a father. Usually a child’s biological father is also their legal father.
  
  If you and the other parent disagree, You may have to prove the identity of your child’s biological father to establish him as the legal father:
  
  * Proving the biological father of a child is called “establishing paternity.”
  * Proving someone is not the biological father is called “disestablishing paternity.”
  
  When a married man and woman have a child:
  
  * The husband is the child’s legal father, even if he is not the biological father.
  * If the husband is not the biological father, you need to disestablish his paternity and establish the biological father’s paternity. After you do this, the biological father will also be the child’s the legal father. 
  
  <div class='step-subheading'>Benefits of Establishing Paternity</div>
  
  Your child gets many benefits from knowing who their biological father is:
  
  * child support, 
  * an inheritance -it can be very hard to prove your child’s biological father if the father is dead,  
  * being included on their father’s health insurance,
  * knowing their father’s medical history,
  * benefits from programs like Social Security and Veterans’ Benefits, and
  * a relationship with their father.
  
  <div class='step-subheading'>Ways to establish paternity</div>
  
  * Sign the Health Analytics & Vital Records Affidavit of Paternity, VS-06-5376 form
      * An unmarried man and woman can sign the Health Analytics & Vital Records Affidavit of Paternity, VS-06-5376 form. This form says the man and woman agree that they are biological parents of a child. 
      * You can also use this form for a husband, wife, and another man to agree that the other man is the biological father – not the husband.
      * You can only get the form from Health Analytics & Vital Records or your local court. After you complete the form, give it to Health Analytics & Vital Records. Do not file it at court.
    
  * Start a case with Child Support Services Division (CSSD):
      * If you apply for CSSD services, you can ask CSSD for help to establish paternity.
      * CSSD can order [DNA testing](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/glossary.htm#dna) to discover if the person you think is your child’s biological father actually is. If he is the father, CSSD can establish paternity.
      * If CSSD establishes paternity, they will order child support. Either parent can open a court case and ask the court for a Parenting Plan so both parents can spend time with their child. Use [Starting a Custody Case](C:\Users\CRobinson\Downloads\LegalNav.org\guided_assistant\starting-a-custody-case\?location=alaska).
  * Start a court case to establish or disestablish paternity
      * If a husband and wife are married when a child is born, the husband is not the biological father. If the husband and wife want to separate, they can start a divorce, dissolution, or legal separation case. and ask the judge to disestablish paternity as part of the divorce case. Use [Starting A Case to End Your Marriage](C:\Users\CRobinson\Downloads\LegalNav.org\guided_assistant\starting-a-custody-case\?location=alaska).
      * If a married husband and wife want to stay married, but the husband is not the biological father of a child, the wife, husband, or another man can start a case to disestablish the husband’s paternity and establish another man’s paternity.
      * If you are not married to the other biological parent when the child is born, you can start a paternity case and ask the judge to find that your child’s biological father is their legal father. If the judge establishes paternity, they can order child support. You can ask the court to open a custody case at the same time and get a Parenting Plan so both parents can spend time with their child. Use[Starting a Custody Case](C:\Users\CRobinson\Downloads\LegalNav.org\guided_assistant\starting-a-custody-case\?location=alaska).
      * See [the court’s paternity forms](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcforms.htm#paternity).
  * Start a court case to disestablish the legal father’s paternity and establish another man as biological father: 
      * This is a complicated situation. Try to talk to a lawyer. [Find a Lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm). 
      * If you are not married and you want to disestablish one man’s paternity and establish another man’s paternity, you can open a paternity case with 3 people in the case:
      
          1. mother, 
          1. the man already established as biological father who may not be the biological father, and
          1. the man you think is the biological father.
          
     * After the judge establishes paternity, you can open a custody case with just yourself and the biological father to ask for Child Support and a Parenting Plan so both parents can spend time with their child.
