  The judge will enter a final child support order at the end of your case, and pick the date child support should start.  
  
  Child support is usually owed when parents do not live together.  
  
  Sometimes, when a case ends, one parent owes the other parent back child support.  
  
  If you do not want to wait until the end of your case, you can ask the judge for an “interim” Child Support order.    
fields:
  - "What do you want to do?": interim_motion
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - "Wait for the judge to order child support at the end of my case. Goto Gen information forms": wait
      - "Ask the judge to order child support while my case is going on. TEM interim motions  affidavit  instructions_tf   order_instructions_tf  Go to kids": ask 
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      An interim order is any order the judge makes before they make the final order or decree. 
      The judge can make short-term decisions about child support, the parenting plan, 
      % if existing_case == 'open' and user_role_in_case == 'defendant' and need_to_respond: 
        % if case_type in('divorce', 'dissolution', 'legal separation'):
       possession of the family home, attorney fees, spousal support or payment of debts
        % endif
      % endif
      . 
      The final order may be entirely different.

      Child support is to support  children  who are under 18.

      Child support orders usually last until your child turns 19 if:
      
      1. They still live with you or their other parent, and
      2. They are finishing high school.

id: Paternity
question: |
  Paternity
subquestion: |
  You and your child's other legal parent are responsible for financially supporting your child.  
  
  A child's biological father is generally their legal father.

  If parents disagree, either parent can ask the court to decide.  
 
  * Proving someone is the **biological** father of a child is called "establishing paternity."
  * Proving someone is not the **biological** father is called "disestablishing paternity." 

  Do you want to add information about establishing or disestablishing paternity to your Personal Action Plan?
fields:
  - no label: paternity
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      Is the law different if my child:
      
      *	is adopted, 
      *	has parents who are the same gender,
      *	has transgender parents, or
      * was conceived by in vitro fertilization, or surrogacy?
      
      A person who adopts a child is the child's legal parent.
      Usually, you cannot “undo” an adoption to “disestablish paternity”.
      
      These situations can be complicated.  If you have questions, it is a good idea to talk to a lawyer.

id: Ask CSSD or the Court for a child support order
question: |
  Ask CSSD or the Court for a child support order
subquestion: |
  A child support order tells one parent to pay child support to the other parent. 
  The Alaska court orders child support as part of a Parenting Plan in divorce, custody, dissolution or legal separation cases.  Parenting Plans are sometimes called “custody orders”.  
  A Parenting Plan is a list of decisions about:
  
  *	which parent pays child support, 
  *	the amount of child support
  *	a schedule for when and how long your children will stay at each parent’s house, 
  *	a holiday schedule,
  *	how you will make decisions about your children, and 
  *	financial questions like: 
    *	“How to spend our children’s PFDs?” or 
    *	“Which parent should claim any child tax credits?”  
  
  The Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD) can order child support but does not order Parenting Plans. CSSD child support orders work best if you do not need a Parenting Plan.  
  What do you want to add to your Personal Action Plan?
fields: 
  - "I want to learn how to ask for child support from:": ask_court_or_cssd
    # label above field: True
    input type: radio
    choices:
  	  - "Alaska Court": court
      - "CSSD": cssd
      - "Both": both
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> How does the court or CSSD decide how much Child Support to order?####
      The Alaska Supreme Court sets the guidelines that judges and Alaska Child Support Services must follow when they decide the amount of child support payments. You can read the rule and the Child Support Guideline Committee’s comments about the rule online See [Child Support Awards in Civil Rule 90.3](https://casetext.com/rule/alaska-court-rules/alaska-rules-of-civil-procedure/part-xii-special-proceedings/rule-903-child-support-awards) or [the court's PDF](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdf)

  Your Personal Action Plan includes information about how to ask the Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD) for a child support order. 
  % endif
  
  If you want the court to order child support, you must start a court case.
  
  If you are not married to the other parent, start a custody case to get a Parenting Plan and child support.
  
  If you are married to the other parent, start a divorce, dissolution, or legal separation case.

question: |
  Plus general CS
subquestion: |
  Do you want your Personal Action Plan to include information to help you fill out the child support forms when you start your case? 
  Yes –  [Affidavit TF] [Order TF]  [affidavit  instructions_tf] [order_instructions_tf]  – Go To kids2 
  No – Go To Interim child support order 3
  
  [Note – Kids 2 is so the user can get general information about forms for starting the case and then tell how many kids and then can be asked if they want interim child support information – if they say yes to both, only need to add about interim motions – do not need to ask how many kids again or give other documents again.  But if they say no, it then asks about interim child support.  I have hopeful you can do it all with logic so each question is only asked once!  I put them multiple times here to be sure you understood the logic.  I am hopeful this is done and we don’t have to discuss language or logic, but if it is not done, please leave in the duplicates until we get it finalized]
